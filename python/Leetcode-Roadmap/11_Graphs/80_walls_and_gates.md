# Walls And Gates
## Company: Amazon
### Level: Medium

You are given a ùëö √ó ùëõ m√ón 2D `grid` initialized with these three possible values:

1. `-1` - A water cell that can not be traversed.
2. `0` - A treasure chest.
3. `INF` - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 `to represent `INF`.
Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain `INF`.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

***Break It Down For Me...***
*We have a grid (like a map) that has `m` rows and `n` columns.*
*Each spot on the grid can have one of three values:*

1. `-1`: *This spot is water and you can't walk on it.*
2. `0`: *This spot has a treasure chest.*
3. `INF`: *This spot is land, and you can walk on it. `INF` is a very large number, which is `2147483647`.*
*Our task is to fill each land spot (`INF`) with the number of steps it takes to get to the nearest treasure chest (`0`).*
*You can only move up, down, left, or right.*

*If a land spot can't reach any treasure chest, it should stay `INF`.*

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69C6xhiSQE) for the solution on [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) **(which I would strongly reccomed you to get familiar with.)**

To solve this challenge we will use [Graphs](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/graphs-in-data-structure#:~:text=Graphs%20in%20data%20structures%20are,circuit%20networks%2C%20and%20social%20networks.) as a data structure in Python & JavaScript.

### Example 1
```
Input: [
  [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
  [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
  [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
  [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [3,-1,0,1],
  [2,2,1,-1],
  [1,-1,2,-1],
  [0,-1,3,4]
]

```

### Example 2
```
Input: [
  [0,-1],
  [2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [0,-1],
  [1,2]
]
```
