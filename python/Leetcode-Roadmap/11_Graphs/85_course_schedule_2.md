# Course Schedule 2
## Company: Google
### Level: Medium

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to `numCourses` - 1. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

***Break It Down To Me...***
*You have to take `numCourses` courses.*
*The courses are numbered from 0 to `numCourses - 1`.*
*Some courses need you to take other courses first.*
*This is given in a list called prerequisites.*
*Each item in this list is a pair `[a, b]` which means you need to take course `b` before you can take course `a`.*

- *For example, `[0, 1]` means you need to take course 1 before you can take course `0`.*

*The job is to find an order in which you can take all the courses. If there are multiple correct orders, any one of them is fine. If it's impossible to take all courses, return an empty list.*

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akt3glAwyfY) for the solution on [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) **(which I would strongly reccomed you to get familiar with.)**

To solve this challenge we will use [Graphs](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/graphs-in-data-structure#:~:text=Graphs%20in%20data%20structures%20are,circuit%20networks%2C%20and%20social%20networks.) as a data structure in Python, JavaScript & Go.
 

### Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
```
**Explanation:** There are a total of `2` courses to take. To take course `1` you should have finished course `0`. So the correct course order is [0,1].

### Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
```
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses `1` and `2`. Both courses `1` and `2` should be taken after you finished course `0`.
So one correct course order is `[0,1,2,3]`. Another correct ordering is `[0,2,1,3]`.

### Example 3:
```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```
