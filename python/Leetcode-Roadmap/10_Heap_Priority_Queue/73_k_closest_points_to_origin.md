Heap / Priority Queue 3
# K Closest Points to Origin
## Company: Meta 
### Level: Medium

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

***Break It Down For Me...***
*We have a list of points. Each point has an X and Y coordinate (like `(3, 4)` or `(-1, 2)`).*
*We need to find the k points that are closest to the origin (which is `(0, 0)`).*

To solve this challenge we will use a [Heap](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/computer-science/data-structures/heap-data-structure/#:~:text=A%20heap%20data%20structure%20is%20a%20type%20of%20binary%20tree,priority%20queues%2C%20or%20scheduling%20programs.) data structure in Python, JavaScript and Go.


### Example 1
![Example 1 Pic](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)
```
Input: points = [[1, 3], [-2, 2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2, 2]]

# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

### Example 2
```
Input: points = [[3,3], [5,-1], [-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3], [-2,4]]

Explanation: The answer [[-2,4], [3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

## Python

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Initialize an empty list to use as a min-heap
        minHeap = []

        # Loop through each point in the list of points
        for x, y in points:
            # Calculate the squared distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y)
            # We use squared distance to avoid computing the square root, which is not necessary for comparison
            dist = (x ** 2) + (y ** 2)
            # Add the distance and point coordinates to the min-heap
            minHeap.append((dist, x, y))
        
        # Convert the list into a heap in-place
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        
        # Initialize an empty list to store the k closest points
        res = []
        # Extract the k smallest elements from the heap

            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

            res.append((x, y))
        
        # Return the list of k closest points
        return res

## JavaScript
```

    // Sort the array with a custom lambda comparator function
    points.sort((a, b) => squaredDistance(a) - squaredDistance(b));
