# Leetcode Problems

The following are solutions created in Python for different LeetCode problems. These aren't always considered the "most 
right" or "most efficient" solutions, they are simply our
member's contributions so feel free to add as you'd like.

> NOTE: Some of the solutions are written with pytest. If you 
would like to run them using pytest, please install pytest with 
`python -m pip install pytest` first, and then tests can be run
with the following commands:
   * runs all the solutions in this directory   
   `pytest ../Leetcode-Problems`
      > NOTE: pytest recognizes files prefixed with <i>"test_"</i>
   * runs a specific problem's solution   
   `pytest test_12_Integer_to_Roman.py`
   * shows more details in the terminal when running all the tests, to help with debug if necessary.   
   `pytest ../Leetcode-Problems --verbose`
