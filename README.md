# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
_This is going to be a repo full of data structure and algorithm challenges from Leetcode and from work._

## Why DSA?
**FOR THE JOB!** LOL, all tech jobs that involve some type of DSA related questions and we want to help share the tips & tricks we all learn to help each other.
___
The following languages are actively being worked on:
* Javascript (js)
* Python
* C++

> NOTE : If you would like another language, feel free to create a branch and add to the repo. We'll have code reviews to help share knowledge & validate code.

**What are Data Strictures?**   
**A.** Ways in which data is organized/stored in code.   

**What are Algorithms... REALLY?**   
**A.** Simply a set of instructions to complete a task. However, in Computer Science, there are specific algorithms used to solve problems like sorting & searching efficiently.

### Language Environment requirements:
___
Code Editor/IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been our most used, so we'll share our extensions that are needed as well as some that are helpful.
#### VS Code Extensions:
* C/C++
* Diff
* Git Graph
* IntelliCode
* Jupyter
* Python

#### C++
* [GNU Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

# Leetcode Roadmap

This branch is a mixture of data structures and algorithm challenges taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).

For each challange, you will find the title, the company which is associated with the challage 
(*please bare in mind that these challenges are not exclusive to company that it's associated with*), 
the difficulty level, an explanation of what the challenge is asking you and my solution along with a video soultion from YouTube.

This will be completed as I progress into my career and revisited as much as possible throught my career.
It always reccomended to do this whether you are a beginner or an expert, so you keep trying to find new ways to improve 
and eventually become more a profficient software developer/engineer.

Most challenges will be done in *Python, JavaScript and Go*.
