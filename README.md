# Leetcode Roadmap

This branch is a mixture of data structures and algorithm challenges taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).

For each challange, you will find the title, the company which is associated with the challage 
(*please bare in mind that these challenges are not exclusive to company that it's associated with*), 
the difficulty level, an explanation of what the challenge is asking you and my solution along with a video soultion from YouTube.

This will be completed as I progress into my career and revisited as much as possible throught my career.
It always reccomended to do this whether you are a beginner or an expert, so you keep trying to find new ways to improve 
and eventually become more a profficient software developer/engineer.

Most challenges will be done in *Python, JavaScript and Go*.
